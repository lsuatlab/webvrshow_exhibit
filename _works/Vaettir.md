## Description
Situated at the edge of the Vatnajökull National Park lies one of Icelands most breathtaking natural landscapes, an ice lagoon formed by melting neighbouring glaciers as they gradually recede under global warming. During the winter months the lagoon freezes beneath the glaciers forming immense cave systems that capture and refract light within as the glaciers tower overhead. The constant monumental forces within the glaciers mean the caves are always in motion, collapsing and expanding, creating a dynamic and ever changing environment. 

Vættir is an ongoing project to explore the dynamic spaces of the natural and built environment. Using photogrammetry and scan data we create abstractions of physical spaces, placing users within a surreal representation that highlights the intrinsic properties of the space.  

## Bios	
We are Kuva, an experimental interaction design studio based in the UK. We create beautiful experiences that both captivate and inspire. Our craft lies somewhere between art, design and technology. We produce work across both virtual and physical spaces including installation, animation, interactive and vr.

***Note:** Viewing content in 360-degrees on your **Desktop** or using a mobile device with **Google Cardboard** does not usually require any special browser setup. For instructions on how to setup your browser to work with a VR headset like the **Oculus Rift** or **HTC Vive** click on the browser name above. The **Samsung Gear VR** and **Google Daydream** are also good choices for experiencing WebVR. If the piece works on Google Cardboard it is likely going to work on these as well.*
