## Abstract
*Lily & Snout* by Alban Denoyel and Bobby Beck is a WebVR short animation. It is the result of a partnership by the two companies Sketchfab and Artella. They present a fully hosted player on the web that can be experienced in VR on any headset. The project demonstrates the potential for vieweing animated content on the web where the viewer takes control of the camera and even provides a glimpse of the creation processs while expreiencing the content by allowing wireframe views and different shader choices. The animated content demonstrates the ability of the browser to render appealing characters while the custom built player is a efficient interface for a variety of content.
