## Description
Illy is a semi-intelligent system powered by Web Audio API, WebGL, WebVR and sometimes Kinect. It understands what it is spoken to in a primitive way and responds to us in a primitive, emotional and simple way both sonically and visually. As opposed to the cutting edge AIs and interfaces like Siri, Cortana, OK Google, Illy does not understand natural language, defined commands or even language at all. It does not respond using fine-tuned intonations to deliver the information gathered from the cloud, it is not integrated with any services. It does not show maps, or pictures about the topic. Instead, as an antithesis, it only tries to understand the sonic properties of the spoken language like the attack, loudness, roughness and pitch. And responds sonically, in a non-language, musical, psychoacoustical way: without the symbolic sounds that we call language but with tonal sounds, timbre, frequency, consonance and rhythm. Visually, it shapes the visuals focusing on size, speed and color determined by its understanding and creating an abstract visual. Ignoring the symbolic data, like an infant, Illy tries to understand the emotion in the human voice - free from symbols of the language - and responds you with your emotions like sonic mirror to the soul. The aimed interactive experience brings questions about human sound and human-machine interface that we sometimes ignore in this age of information. 

With WebVR, not only Illy can be accessible with a click but also Illy leaves the confines of 2D-screens and becomes ‘the ideal’ AI, floating around the space always open to conversing and not helping with any of our tasks including setting alarms, playing music or calling a cab. Instead, Illy gives us a naïve communication channel that we can establish with an infant or an animal. 

Finally, as a web project, Illy will continue to evolve musically and visually and will add new tricks to its skill set while keeping the focus of the experience same.

***Note:** Viewing content in 360-degrees on your **Desktop** or using a mobile device with **Google Cardboard** does not usually require any special browser setup. For instructions on how to setup your browser to work with a VR headset like the **Oculus Rift** or **HTC Vive** click on the browser name above. The **Samsung Gear VR** and **Google Daydream** are also good choices for experiencing WebVR. If the piece works on Google Cardboard it is likely going to work on these as well.*
