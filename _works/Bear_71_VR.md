For instructions on how to setup your browser to work with a VR headset like the **Oculus Rift** or **HTC Vive** click on the browser name above. The **Samsung Gear VR** and **Google Daydream** are also good choices for experiencing WebVR. If the piece works on Google Carboard it is likely to work on these as well.*

## Description
The National Film Board of Canada (NFB) is making groundbreaking, immersive virtual reality experiences more accessible than ever―starting with a webVR reinvention of the NFB’s multi-award-winning interactive doc, Bear 71, now available free on Chrome as Bear 71 VR.
Originally launched in 2012, Bear 71 is an acclaimed interactive multi-user online experience told from the point of view of an omniscient female grizzly bear―dubbed “Bear 71” by the park rangers who track her. Created by Jeremy Mendes, Leanne Allison and the NFB, Bear 71 explores how we coexist with wildlife in the age of networks, surveillance, and digital information en mass.

Developed using open platform WebVR technology for greater accessibility, Bear 71 VR is now available using a Daydream-ready phone such as Pixel and Daydream View, and can also be viewed as a 2D interactive experience. It will soon be available in additional VR headsets as WebVR support expands further in Chrome and other major web browsers(Cardboard in April, Vive/Oculus in August).

Created in collaboration with Google’s Chrome and VR teams, IDFA DocLab and Sound and Vision, Bear 71 VR has been showcased as a VR installation by the NFB at IDFA Doclab and by Google at the New Frontiers VR Bar at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. It now joins such acclaimed NFB VR works as the Webby Award-winners The Unknown Photographer (Turbulent/NFB), Way to Go (NFB/France Télévisions) and Cardboard Crash (NFB).
