## Description
Omaha is an immersive WebVR piece that strings together worlds of nostalgia -- a universe from which there appears to be no way out. The experience is a series of very simple scenes or chapters, each referencing a piece of media that was at one point so inescapable as to invoke fond memories of that media in spite of or even because of its flaws. Omaha is intended as an experiment in rapid iteration of small, shareable meme-like moments in the tradition of animated gifs or Vine.
