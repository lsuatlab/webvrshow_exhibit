## Description
*Way to Go* is an interactive experience for human beings between 5 and 105 years old. Maybe it lasts six minutes; maybe it lasts forever. *Way to Go* is ready for your web browser and willing to go VR, if you're Rift-y. It is like a gray squirrel balanced on a branch, fearless. Made by [Vincent Morisset](http://vincentmorisset.com/), [Caroline Robert](http://caroline-robert.com/), [Édouard Lanctôt-Benoit](http://edouardlb.com/) and the studio [AATOAA](http://www.aatoaa.com/), visionary creators of BLA BLA and Arcade Fire's award-winning Just A Reflektor. Produced by the National Film Board of Canada, co-produced by France Televisions, with a mesmerizing soundtrack by Philippe Lambert, it is a game and a solace and an alarm, a wake-up call to the hazards of today. At a moment when we have access to so much, and see so little, Way to Go will remind you of all that lies before you, within you, in the luscious, sudden pleasure of discovery.
