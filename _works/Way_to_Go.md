## Description
Way to Go is an interactive experience for human beings between 5 and 105 years old. Maybe it lasts six minutes; maybe it lasts forever. Way to Go is ready for your web browser and willing to go VR, if you're Rift-y. It is like a grey squirrel balanced on a branch, fearless. Made by Vincent Morisset, Caroline Robert, Édouard Lanctôt-Benoit and the studio AATOAA, visionary creators of BLA BLA and Arcade Fire's award-winning Just A Reflektor. Produced by the National Film Board of Canada, co-produced by France Televisions, with a mesmerizing soundtrack by Philippe Lambert, it is a game and a solace and an alarm, a wake-up call to the hazards of today. At a moment when we have access to so much, and see so little, Way to Go will remind you of all that lies before you, within you, in the luscious, sudden pleasure of discovery.

His work has been showcased in Wired, Creative Review, Pitchfork, Rolling Stones, Le Monde and The Guardian among others. Creativity Magazine, Shots and Boards selected Vincent in their directors to watch list. Recently, Vincent directed a dance activated interactive video for Arcade Fire (sprawl2.com), BLA BLA (blabla.nfb.ca), an experimental !lm for computer and INNI, a feature !lm on the icelandic band Sigur Ros.
