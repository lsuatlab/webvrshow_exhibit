## Description
*Mass Migrations* is a generative, interactive VR installation. 
Originally started as an infinite, procedurally generated environment, this version of the project lets people build their own creatures/robots, interact with them and set them free. The experience is best with 2 users each with their own Vive remote. Creations can be downloaded as 3D OBJ files or 2D JPEGs.
