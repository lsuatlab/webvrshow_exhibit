## Description
*Maratropa* by Marpi is an extensive data art project, visualizing any Twitter account as an abstract city. The structure in the middle, with shape and size dependent on the growth of each following, symbolizes religious like objectification, while everything around is based on "followers." The abstraction of Twitter networks creates a unique visualization of the social platforms interconnectedness.
