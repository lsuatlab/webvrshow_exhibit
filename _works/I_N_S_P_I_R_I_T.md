## Description
I N S P I R I T may seem to be a story about light, but it is really more about people. People who enlighten us and complete us; because I like to think that there are people whose presence lights us up inside.   

## Bios	
Since childhood I have dreamed to create imaginary worlds and now I've learned to draw and bring them to life with code. 

I obtained my B.Sc. in Geological Science in 2000 but I've only worked in online development related jobs as interactive designer/developer. In 2010 I founded unboring.net with the main goal to create a new interactive entertainment and to help brands to create inmersive experiences.
This year my effort is centered in the world of 3D web and the emergence of VR, that give me the opportunity to offer new ways of interacting with content.

Now, my goal is to create innovative projects that demonstrate that through the Web you can get amazing results.

***Note:** Viewing content in 360-degrees on your **Desktop** or using a mobile device with **Google Cardboard** does not usually require any special browser setup. For instructions on how to setup your browser to work with a VR headset like the **Oculus Rift** or **HTC Vive** click on the browser name above. The **Samsung Gear VR** and **Google Daydream** are also good choices for experiencing WebVR. If the piece works on Google Cardboard it is likely going to work on these as well.*
