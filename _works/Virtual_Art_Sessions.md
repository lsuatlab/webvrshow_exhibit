## Description
*Virtual Art Sessions* by the Google Data Arts Team lets the user observe six world-renowned artists as they develop blank canvases into beautiful works of art using Tilt Brush, a VR drawing tool. Artists were recorded with 3D volumetric video, so each session can be explored in interactive mixed reality, from start to finish. By showing the artists in the context of their VR artwork, we give users a unique look into the process and possibilities of using VR as a new creative medium. On any desktop or mobile browser, you can watch the sessions in 3D WebGL. Spin around to view the process from any angle, even from the artist's perspective. The site gives people who might not have access to room-scale VR a deeper understanding of how it works and the creative potential it contains.Users with a room-scale VR setup can view the project in WebVR and step into the room with the artist at work. The user can walk around the artist and sculpture, speed up and slow down time, and even adjust the scale of the artist: shrink them to miniature and watch a tiny 3D sculpture come to life in your hands, or scale them into a towering giant and see them create strokes the size of skyscrapers.    

## Bios	
The Data Arts Team is a specialized coder and designer collective within Google whose sole task is the advancement of what creativity and technology can do together. Some of their most interesting work emerges from collaborations with directors, artists and musicians. Their work has been exhibited at the TATE Modern, Tribeca Film Festival, and the TED Conference.

***Note:** Viewing content in 360-degrees on your **Desktop** or using a mobile device with **Google Cardboard** does not usually require any special browser setup. For instructions on how to setup your browser to work with a VR headset like the **Oculus Rift** or **HTC Vive** click on the browser name above. The **Samsung Gear VR** and **Google Daydream** are also good choices for experiencing WebVR. If the piece works on Google Cardboard it is likely going to work on these as well.*
