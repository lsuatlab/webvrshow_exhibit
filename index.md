The ACM SIGGRAPH Digital Arts Community presents, *Immersive Expressions* an online WebVR exhibition that explores the browser as a medium for work at the intersection of creative expression and virtual reality. Chosen works include those that push conceptual and technological boundaries including interactive experiments, games, animation, 360-degree video experiences, and other hybrid approaches. This includes works that are more abstract and conceptual, or those created by creative technologists with a unique approach to virtual reality. Indie developers, artists, designers, computer scientists, filmmakers, and companies working at the forefront of web-based VR are showcased.
