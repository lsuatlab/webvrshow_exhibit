## Instructions

To experience content in virtual reality you will need a headset like the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard, Google Daydream, or Samsung Gear VR with a WebVR enabled browser like Firefox or Chrome. It's often a good idea to use the latest version of these browsers to take advantage of the newest features like Firefox Nightly, Chrome Canary, or a Chromium build tuned for Web VR. See the below instructions for various settings you might have to set.

## Desktop or Mobile 360Â° Viewing

Many WebVR sites allow the option for viewing content using the Desktop or Mobile device with a modern web browser without a headset. They often do this by providing a means for navigating in 360-degrees through panning, orbiting, and zooming with the cursor.

## Oculus Rift

If you're using the Oculus Rift for viewing WebVR  you may initially get a screen saying you can't view content from "Unknown Sources." You will need to "Enable Unknown Sources" from the Oculus settings to fix this:

1. Go to Oculus Application Settings > General Settings
2. Turn on "Unknown Sources"
3. Use Firefox or Chromium to view content.
