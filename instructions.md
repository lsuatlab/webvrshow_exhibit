## Desktop(360)

Many WebVR sites allow the option for viewing content using the Desktop with a modern web browser. They often do this by providing a means for navigting in 360-degrees through panning, orbitting, and zooming with the cursor. 

To experience content in virtual reality you will need a headset like the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard, Google Daydream, or Samsung Gear VR with a WebVR enabled browser like Firefox or Chrome. It's often a good idea to use the latest version of these browsers to take advantage of the newest features like Firefox Nightly, Chrome Canary, or a Chromium build tuned for Web VR. See the below instructions for various settings you might have to set.

## Oculus Rift

If you're using the Oculs Rift for viewing WebVR  you may initially get a screen saying you can't view content from "Unknown Sources." You will need to "Enable Unknown Sources" from the Oculus settings to fix this:

1. Go to Oculus Application Settings > General Settings
2. Turn on "Unkown Sources"
3. Use Firefox or Chromium to view content.
